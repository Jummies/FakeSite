A place which transports you to a timeless world far away from modern Bangkok. Friendship, family, community, pride - and celebration after a hard days work - are the rhythms that make the village tick. \n\nThe film shares the life of Suman - a farmer and craftsman dedicated to the traditional ways of country living. Suman is an important part of village life - with the instruments he makes being essential in celebrations, get togethers, birthdays and drinking sessions. \n\nIn a time when global culture is slowly eroding unique traditions, we wanted to celebrate a simpler and more authentic way of life we found in Suman\u2019s peaceful and mediative world.\n\nFull of energy and human warmth - this film is a thank-you to all the amazing Thai folks that have introduced us to their culture in the most welcoming and warming of ways - through good food, traditional music, friendship\u2026 and whiskey.\n\nWinner \u2018Best Original Music\u2019 Mosaic Film Festival 2020\nWinner \u2018Best Sound\u2019 Mosaic Film Festival 2020\nFinalist Canada Shorts Film Festival 2020\nSemi-Finalist Top Shorts Film Festival 2020\nOfficial Selection 9Film Fest 2020\nOfficial Selection Sonic Scene Music Film Festival 2020\nOfficial Selection AmDocs Film Festival 2021\n\nDirector: Tubby Brother\nDOP: Dan Tubby\nEditor: Ben Tubby\nComposer: Rob Law\nColourist: Simone Grattarola @ Time Based Arts\nSound Design: Martin Leitner @ Wave",

    "description": "An empty, immaculate high-end residence. Every design object and piece of furniture occupies a specific, calculated space. The utility doesn't seem to matter or take place, the form's smoothness and perfection is everything. Everything is calm, perfect, the light embraces the space and its beautiful design. But there are other objects that escape that standard, that are of a different kind. Objects that inhabit every house, purely functional or that simply clash with the aesthetic pretension of the environment. Used and left aside, hidden, concealed, disguised, made invisible, as if they were shameful. These are the ones who break into the aseptic landscape and take it by storm. A blow worthy of a class struggle, where a useful minority rebels against pretension and sets out to tear down its symbols.\n\n\nA short film by Six N.
